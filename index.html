                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;"><img style="height: 400px; width: 80%" src="https://www.rowlen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nintchdbpict000388169320-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg"></div>
                    <p>
                        As the gas prices rise, homeowners are concerned about rising energy bills. However, there are ways to save money and use less energy with an efficient central heating system. Read on for our top tips to get the most out of your heating system.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Schedule an Annual Boiler Service</h2>
                    <p>
                        A boiler service by a Gas Safe Registered engineer can keep your boiler running smoothly and prevent minor faults from developing into major issues. This can save you money in the long run and prevent your boiler from breaking down during the winter months.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Check Your Boiler Settings</h2>
                    <p>
                        Setting your combi boiler’s flow temperature too high can waste energy and decrease efficiency. Most heating systems can operate at lower temperatures while still keeping your home warm. We recommend setting your flow temperature to around 60°C, which can be done using the dials on the front of your boiler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For modern condensing boilers, reducing the flow temperature to 60°C will maximize efficiency and save energy. Monitor your heating over the next few days and adjust the flow temperature until you find a comfortable temperature that is not wasting energy.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Use a Smart Thermostat</h2>
                    <p>
                        A smart thermostat can help you save energy and cut costs by giving you greater control over your heating. You can use features like geolocation to prevent heating an empty house and adjust your heating when you’re not at home.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Set a Heating Schedule</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using your thermostat to set a heating schedule can optimize your heating to fit your lifestyle. For instance, you can turn the heat off while you’re at work or lower the overall temperature in your home by a few degrees in the morning. Try setting your room thermostat to 18°C and gradually adjust it until you find a comfortable temperature that saves energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also a good idea to review your heating schedule when your routine changes, like during a seasonal shift or working from home on certain days.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Check Your Radiators</h2>
                    <p>
                        Air can make its way into your heating system over time, causing your radiators to take longer to heat up or be cold at the top. Bleeding your radiators can correct this. Similarly, calling out a heating engineer to balance your radiators, ensuring they are supplied with the exact amount of heat they need, can increase your system’s efficiency by up to 15%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your radiator is cold at the bottom, it may be the result of a sludge buildup. You can call out an engineer to power flush the system to clean it, or try doing it yourself with our article.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Utilize Your Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Set your TRVs to a lower level and gradually turn them up until the room is at a comfortable temperature. Turning up the TRV to a higher setting immediately won’t heat the room any faster, and it’s the boiler and radiator size that affects heating time. TRVs also allow you to turn off the heating in rooms you don’t use often, like spare bedrooms.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Perform a Home Audit</h2>
                    <p>
                        Check for areas where heat might be escaping, like drafty windows or doors, and put measures in place to prevent this. Use radiator reflectors, close your curtains, and keep doors closed between rooms.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Don’t Leave Your Heating On All Day</h2>
                    <p>
                        Leaving your heating on when you’re not at home wastes energy and increases wear and tear on your system. Instead, heat your home only when it feels cold, and you’ll save energy and money in the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, using these tips can help homeowners save money and energy while staying warm during the winter season. Regular maintenance, efficient settings, and smart technology can make a big difference in reducing energy bills and preventing heating system breakdowns.
                    </p>
